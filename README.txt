Assignment: Project 2: Reinforcement Learning for Robot Wall Following

**OVERVIEW**
The goal of this assignment was to write a ROS node that allows the robot to follow a wall using Q-tables that it populated through the Q-Learning & SARSA Reinforcement Learning training methods. The states must be the robot's sensor data and based on this state and the Q-table, the the published action should allow for the robot to follow a wall. Within the same folder as this README.txt file is the ROS packages containing the code to execute the solutions to this assignment. Additionally, a demo video of the working robot has been posted to youtube. The ROS package names and video links are provided below:



ROS Package Folder Name: wall_follow_qlearning
Demo Video Link: https://youtu.be/DFaiHgMJvXc

ROS Package Folder Name: wall_follow_sarsa
Demo Video Link: https://youtu.be/RI4NhKOeDt8

Within each ROS package folder is a README file. Follow the steps within these README files for compiling and running the code yourself.
